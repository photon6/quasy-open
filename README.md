# QuASy-Open

**Query Anonymization System** – Open-source engine to **detect and abstract sensitive IP** (trade secrets, inventions, product names) from queries before sending them to public LLMs.

- **Never leaks your data**  
- **Plugs into OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, etc.**  
- **Reconstructs full context** for your private model  
- **MIT Licensed** – use, modify, deploy freely  

Perfect for R&D teams using LLMs without risking IP exposure.
